This project has now been deprecated now no new version will be out


### Reasons for deprecation

-> poor documentation of Zig lang
-> was not able to find any help regarding file IO
-> poor api support in zig
-> poor support for zig and c types interoperability
-> Not a single examples that demonstrates the dumping of structure
   or enum in a file

### Work Done and resumability of project
-> Vm emulator / interpreter work was so fine
-> project will only continue iff file IO works correctly and we will
   be able to dump struct or enums in a file
